### Course Description

This course provides an overview of design and estimation for statistical sampling. Computational procedures in the class will be conducted using R and/or SAS.


### Learning Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of this course, students will:

- Learn the classical sampling survey procedures applied to finite populations (including simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling).

- Learn sampling methods that utilize unequal probability sampling.

- Learn ratio and regression analytical methods that utilize auxiliary variable information.

- Learn bootstrap resampling estimation methods.

- Gain practical experience via proposing and  running a sampling design, and presenting the results in a statistical report and formal class presentation.

### Office Hours

- M: 2 - 3
- WF 12 - 1

### Prerequisites

- Required: One of: STAT 217Q, STAT 332, or STAT 401

### Textbooks

- *Sampling: Design and Analysis, second edition*, by Sharon Lohr.
Note: the first edition acceptable

### Additional Resources
Analysis and data visualization will be implemented with:

- R / R Studio
- [STAT 408 Materials](http://math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/)
- [R Studio Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)

### Course Policies


#### Grading Policy

- **10%** of your grade will be determined by weekly quizzes to be completed prior to class on Mondays.

- **15%** of your grade will be determined by homework assignments. Students are allowed and encouraged to work with classmates on homework assignments, but each student is required to complete their own homework. 

- **15%** of your grade will be determined by lab assignments. Labs will be in-class group assignments. Often there
will be a large computational element in the labs.


- **20%** of your grade will be determined by a midterm exam. The midterm exam will have two parts: an in class exam and a take home portion. The in class portions will be largely conceptual including some short mathematical derivations. The take home portions will focus on analysis of data and implementation of Bayesian computational methods. 

- **20%** of your grade will be determined by a final exam. The final exam will have two parts: an in class exam and a take home portion. The in class portions will be largely conceptual including some short mathematical derivations. The take home portions will focus on analysis of data and implementation of Bayesian computational methods. 

- **20%** of your grade will be determined by a project. There are two options for the project: carryout a sampling scheme to address a research question of your choosing or conduct a sampling scheme on a synthetic example. Additional details about the project can be found [here](https://github.com/stat446/Project/blob/master/ProjectOverview.pdf). The final project will consist of written summary including an overview of the sampling design, and analysis of the data, and a summary of the results, as well as an in-class presentation.

#### Collaboration
University policy states that, unless otherwise specified, students may not collaborate on graded material. Any exceptions to this policy will be stated explicitly for individual assignments. If you have any questions about the limits of collaboration, you are expected to ask for clarification.

In this class students are encouraged to collaborate on homework assignments, but quizzes should be completed without collaboration.


####  Academic Misconduct
Section 420 of the Student Conduct Code describes academic misconduct as including but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, multiple submissions, or facilitating others’ misconduct. Possible sanctions for academic misconduct range from an oral reprimand to expulsion from the university.

#### Disabilities Policy

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities. Make sure to include all that relevant information here.

### Course Outline

The course will cover the following topics:

1. Introduction to sampling and scope of interest,
2. Simple random sampling,
3. Stratification,
4. Bootstrap method,
5. Ratio and regression estimators,
6. Cluster sampling,
7. Sampling with unequal probability, and
8. Other topics based on student interest as time permits (including capture-recapture procedures, ...).
